# Art Space Gallery App üñºÔ∏è

This is the final project for Unit 2 of the "Android Basics with Compose" course. It's an interactive app that functions as a mini art gallery. Users can view pieces of artwork, each with a title and artist name, and navigate through the collection using "Previous" and "Next" buttons.

## Project Overview

This project combines state management, UI layout, and user interaction to create a complete, small-scale application. It demonstrates the ability to manage the state of a collection of data and update the UI accordingly.

## Key Learnings

* Managing state for an index within a list or array.
* Creating a polished layout with distinct sections for the image, description, and controls.
* Using `Button`s to modify state and control the application flow.
* Adding decorative elements like a `border` and `shadow` for better visual appeal.
* Reinforcing all the core concepts of Jetpack Compose from the first two units.
